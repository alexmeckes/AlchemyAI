# AlchemyAI - Comprehensive Project Documentation

## Project Overview

AlchemyAI is an immersive alchemical crafting game that combines traditional RPG elements with AI-powered content generation. Players explore magical locations, gather reagents, craft potions using LLM-generated recipes, and complete quests in a rich fantasy world.

## Recent Major Updates & Features

### 1. Crafting Interface Improvements

#### Progressive Step Display
- **Implementation**: Crafting steps now appear progressively with 1.5-second delays between each step
- **Visual Design**: Removed individual green borders for a cleaner, chat-like appearance
- **User Experience**: Steps flow naturally as a continuous conversation rather than separate message bubbles
- **CSS Changes**: 
  - Removed `border-left: 3px solid #4CAF50`
  - Removed background colors and heavy padding
  - Added transparent backgrounds with minimal spacing

#### Chat-Style Output
- **Format**: All crafting output appears as flowing text without visual separators
- **Typography**: Maintains monospace font (Courier New) for terminal aesthetic
- **Responsiveness**: Clean display across all device sizes

### 2. LLM-Powered Gathering System

#### Text-Based Location Exploration
- **Command Interface**: Players use text commands to explore locations
  - `examine` - Detailed location inspection
  - `search` - Active searching for hidden reagents
  - `listen` - Audio-based discovery
  - `focus` - Concentrated exploration
  - `gather` - Collect available reagents
  - `help` - Command reference

#### Dynamic Location Responses
- **AI Integration**: Each location has unique personality and response patterns
  - **Crystal Caves**: Ancient, resonant, musical personality
  - **Moonlit Grove**: Ethereal, wise, nurturing personality  
  - **Frozen Peaks**: Harsh, challenging, unforgiving personality
- **Context Awareness**: Responses adapt based on:
  - Player's discovery history
  - Available reagents
  - Gathering cooldown status
  - Previous exploration attempts

#### Discovery Mechanics
- **Hidden Reagents**: Players start with basic reagents, must discover others
- **Discovery Chance**: 30% chance on exploration commands
- **Progressive Knowledge**: Discovered reagents persist across sessions
- **Mystery Elements**: LLM hints at undiscovered reagents without revealing names

### 3. Dynamic Reagent Generation

#### AI-Generated Reagents
- **Implementation**: 40% of discoveries are completely new, AI-generated reagents
- **Location Themes**: 
  - Crystal Caves: Resonance, harmony, crystalline properties
  - Moonlit Grove: Lunar, ethereal, mystical properties
  - Frozen Peaks: Ice, endurance, frost properties
- **Structured Output**: LLM generates NAME, RARITY, AMOUNT, UNIT, DESCRIPTION
- **Persistence**: Dynamic reagents are saved and can be gathered repeatedly

#### Reagent Categories
- **Static Reagents**: Pre-defined reagents with consistent properties
- **Dynamic Reagents**: AI-generated with ✨ prefix in UI
- **Discovery Balance**: 60% static, 40% dynamic for new discoveries

### 4. Enhanced Quest System

#### Quest States & Flow
- **Unopened**: Initial sealed message state
- **Pending**: Interactive dialogue phase with Master Aldric
- **Active**: Quest objectives tracking
- **Completed**: Reward distribution and completion celebration

#### Interactive Dialogue
- **Real-time Chat**: Players converse with NPCs using natural language
- **AI Responses**: Claude generates contextual NPC dialogue
- **Quest Progression**: Dialogue naturally leads to quest acceptance
- **Character Development**: NPCs have consistent personalities and motivations

#### Quest Completion Tracking
- **Objective Types**:
  - Effect-based: Create potions with specific effects
  - Rarity-based: Achieve minimum rarity thresholds
  - Ingredient-based: Use specific reagents
  - Byproduct-based: Generate particular byproducts
- **Real-time Updates**: Quest progress updates immediately upon crafting
- **Reward System**: Automatic reward distribution upon completion

### 5. Advanced UI/UX Features

#### Tabbed Interface
- **Horizontal Tabs**: Clean navigation between game sections
- **Sections**:
  - **Craft**: Potion brewing interface
  - **Inventory**: Reagent and potion management
  - **Quests**: Quest tracking and dialogue
  - **Gather**: Location exploration and reagent collection

#### Inventory Management
- **Reagent Tracking**: Quantities, units, and descriptions
- **Potion Collection**: Crafted potions with effects and rarity
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time inventory changes
- **Visual Indicators**: Different styling for static vs dynamic reagents

#### Location Interface
- **Location Cards**: Visual representation of gathering locations
- **Status Indicators**: Ready, cooldown, or gathering states
- **Reagent Discovery**: Progressive revelation of available reagents
- **Cooldown Timers**: Real-time countdown until next gathering opportunity

### 6. Backend Architecture

#### Claude AI Integration
- **Multiple Endpoints**:
  - Recipe generation with streaming responses
  - Location exploration responses
  - Dynamic reagent creation
  - NPC dialogue generation
  - Item description generation

#### API Structure
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time content delivery for immersive experience
- **Caching System**: Recipe caching for consistent results
- **Quest Management**: In-memory quest state tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for AI service issues

#### Data Models
```typescript
interface Material {
  name: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface Recipe {
  hash: string;
  materials: Material[];
  incantation: string;
  steps: ReactionStep[];
  result: PotionResult;
  timestamp: string;
}

interface Quest {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  requester: string;
  objectives: QuestObjective[];
  reward: string;
  status: 'unopened' | 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed';
  dialogue: DialogueMessage[];
  initialMessage: string;
}
```

### 7. Game Mechanics

#### Crafting System
